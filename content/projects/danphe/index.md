Embarking on a journey of exploration and learning, our robotics team achieved a significant milestone in 2008 with the completion of Nepal's First Ultralight Aircraft project. Comprising a dedicated group of students, this venture reflects our commitment to hands-on experience and continuous learning in the field of robotics. 

We burrowed the name 'Danphe' as a homage to the national bird of Nepal. The cost of manufacture of this aircraft was incredibly low(10,000 Euros). A Russian pilot Aleander Maximov flew the plane in it's test flight which was a massive success.
